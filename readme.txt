== Description ==
LevelUP is a Design Library for Elementor that offers unlimited pre-built designs for FREE. We will be creating and releasing new design elements every week which will be deliveried directly to your elementor. Our designs are optimized for performance and compatible with AMP. 

### NOTICE 

LevelUP has been depreciated but the innovation will be continued on another revolutionary plugin called AMP Enhancer (Compatibility Layer for Official AMP Plugin), so we recommend you to use [AMP Enhancer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp-enhancer/) plugin. Regular development will be done here as well as customer support will be provided.

LevelUP's core feature is the design library, it's fully plug and play. If you want to get new designs on daily basis, you need to [connect to our server through an API key](http://wplevelup.com/register/) which is totally FREE (and will be free forever).

We do not track any of your data, we just deliver the design elements through API. If you don't wish to connect then you can still use the plugin but it will only give you access to the pre-built 10 designs. If you have doubts about the data or privacy then you can check our [terms](http://wplevelup.com/terms/) or directly contact us on [team@magazine3.com](mailto:team@magazine3.com).

We are also working on the Gutenberg compatibility which will be coming with the future updates.

= Demo =
* [Non-AMP Version](https://wplevelup.com) | [AMP Version](https://wplevelup.com/amp/). In this example, we spent less than 2 minutes on the AMP and yet it's exactly the same with valid output.
